# one_page_x
Sample APP - Qt 5.7+ - Android iOS

This app is part of my blog series about mobile x-platform development:
http://j.mp/qt-x

This is not a real-live app - this app demonstrates the use of Material style:

* first steps with Qt 5.7 and Qt Quick Controls 2
* High DPI support and images
* customizing Qt Quick Controls
* dark and light theme
* fonts and colors

The app is a simple one-page app without navigation

TODO

This app needs Qt 5.7 Beta and will be updated as soon as Qt 5.7 RC is out with different namespace for Qt QUick Controls 2 (qt.labs.controls)
